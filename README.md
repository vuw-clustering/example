Example repository to demonstrate Github and recommended structure.

Please look at the Wiki pages for more information on setting up Github, and on using Github with RStudio.

Before setting up a new repository, please read this page on the recommended structure for a Github project within VUW Clustering, which explains how to set up the project in that way and why it's a good idea.
